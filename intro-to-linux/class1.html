                    <p>I'm going into my senior year at Wheaton College, studying English Writing with a Peace &
                        Conflict
                        certificate. I've
                        loved computer coding ever since I was in elementary school taking drag-and-drop coding summer
                        classes. In high school,
                        I was on a robotics team that went to the world finals! Then in college I took a semester of
                        Java.
                        Although it was
                        tricky, I loved creating something out of nothing. I'm passionate about peace, women in STEM,
                        and
                        the beautiful state of
                        Vermont! I'm currently working on my second novel while listening to Noah Kahan, and am very
                        excited
                        to learn Linux with

                    <li>Written in the C programming language which made UNIX a portable operating system that could be

                        and improve development environments.

                <h4>Learn Linux! (they say)</h4>
                <h5>But... why?</h5>
                <p class="fragment">Although Windows, and macOS(to a certain extent) dominate PCs and laptops, Linux has
                    become <i>the</i>
                    operating system for: cloud computing, carrier data centers, financial markets, embedded systems,
                    and more.<br>
                    Because Linux is open-source, meaning anybody can modify or contribute to the source code, Linux can
                    be changed to fit the needs of your business, and keep computing costs down.</p>

                <!-- https://web.archive.org/web/20200421021348/https://www.linuxfoundation.org/projects/case-studies/linux/ -->

                <p>
                    Linux can be arranged to work in clusters so that multiple systems and machines appear as one to the
                    public.
                    Services can be configured to navigate between these clusters, while maintaining the appearance that
                    they are running without interruption.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To manage your computing resources, Linux can run as a virtualization host. On this host you can run
                    other Linux systems, Microsoft, as guest operating systems.
                    (But still appear to be separate machines to the outside world).
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Linux can be configured for real-time computing, where high priority processes can expect fast,
                    predictable attention."(The Linux Bible, page 5)

                <h4>Ubuntu</h4>
                <p>
                    For this class, we will be using Ubuntu Desktop, which can be found <a
                        href="https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop">here</a><Br>
                    <span>Why Ubuntu?</span> Ubuntu is one of the most widely used distributions by enterprises, and
                    they have a very nice desktop experience for regular users.

                <h4>Back up! What is a distribution?</h4>
                <p>Recall the "kernel." It could be seen as a seed, or also as the foundation of an operating system. A
                    kernel is the core software that manages
                    hardware resources and allows other programs to communicate.
                </p>
                <p>A <i>distribution</i> (distro for short) is a complete house built on this foundation. It includes
                    the kernel, but also adds essential tools and functionalities.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h4 class="left-align">Tools and Functionalities</h4>
                <p><b>Package management system</b>: Imagine a toolbox. A distro's package manager lets you easily
                    install, update, and remove software applications.</p>
                <p><b>Shell and utilities</b>: The shell is a command-line interface that allows you to interact with
                    the system. Utilities are like individual tools that perform specific tasks.</p>
                <p><b>Desktop environment</b>(<span>optional</span>): This provides the graphical user interface (GUI)
                    that everybody is familiar with on Windows or macOS. Some distros cater to server use and may not
                    include a GUI by default!</p>
                <p>Lastly, some distros come pre-loaded with a variety of applications for common tasks like browsing
                    the web, writing documents, or playing media.</p>
